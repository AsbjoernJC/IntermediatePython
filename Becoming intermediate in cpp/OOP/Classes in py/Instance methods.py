#it's good practice to have a instance method that returns a string containing useful information
#about the instance object (eg. dog a)

print(a)    #Prints: <__main__.Dog object at 0x0000027C6D263C40>
#this shows where the object is stored in memory. It can be changed with a special instance
#method called __str__()

#cause of the changes (def description(self)) was commented out. print(a) now returns:
#Jakob is 5 years old.

#methods like __init__() and __str__() are called dunder methods. As they begin and end with
#double underscores. There are many more than these two
